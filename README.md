# FishSwapFu
![FishSwapFu](https://github.com/brujoloco/Images/blob/main/FishFU.png)
A conversion of Draiscor FishSwap into Fubar, for the DOZENS of us that still use it :)

As an avid fisherman in all of my gazillion alts, I just fell in love automatically with
Draiscor idea, which is quite good, you just swap with a single button your weapons exchanging
them for your fishing pole ... then when done fishing click a single button again and 
Boom! Back to your weapon setup!

So I made this:

![In your Fubar Bar](https://github.com/brujoloco/Images/blob/main/FIshFu2.jpg)

Long story short I decided to try my luck converting his original mod that made a draggable button 
in  your ui into a FuBar mod, because as I mentioned before, there are dozens of us still
around using it and after all these years I like all my info visually at the bottom of
my screen and here it is, for your viewing pleasure and use my fellow FuBarians!

## Functions

It has a single word of text depending on what you wielding:

1. If you wielding weapons, it says WEAPONS ...
2. If you wielding a pole, it says ... yeah POLE, this for your visual orientation
3. You can disable the basic information text
4. you can disable the icon as well, you maniac.
5. a fish here, imagine it.

## Installation

Dont be lazy and just add the repository, here for the ultra lazy : https://github.com/brujoloco/FishSwapFu.git

If you are a maniac and want to do it manually like in the olden days, download file, remove the master from the unpacked folder,
drop in your addons directory, enable in game.


What else can I say?  MIT LICENSE, any bugs report it , yadda yadda

Man I love fishing in WoW!
